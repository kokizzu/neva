Your task is to generate a prompt that I can copy and paste into a new clean chat with AI agent to continue work on current problem, because context window of this one is almost full.

Make sure you do NOT omit ANY important information. Everything we've discussed including my original request, all insights found during the session, all the changes we've made, etc.

The result prompt should be rather big and detailed, with motivation, proposed solution, upsides and downsides if any, etc. Also try to include as much low-level details as possible. Start from higher level overview and go down.

Remember, if you omit any important information, I will not be able to continue work on the issue, which means the future of the project is in danger. This is a very important task, so please do your best.
