## ü§î What Is Nevalang?

Nevalang is a new kind of programming language where instead of writing step-by-step instructions, you create networks where data flows between nodes as immutable messages, with everything running in parallel by default. After type-checking, your program is compiled into machine code and can be distributed as a single executable with zero dependencies.

Neva excels at stream processing and concurrency while remaining simple and enjoyable for general development. Future updates will add visual programming and Go interop to enable gradual adoption.

### Why Yet Another Programming Language?

We created it because we saw a gap in the programming language landscape:

1. **Visual Programming Done Right** - existing visual tools are limited to specific domains or lack the power of traditional programming languages. Neva is designed from the ground up to be a hybrid visual/textual programming language.
2. **Simple Parallelism** - Most languages treat concurrency as an advanced feature. In Neva, parallelism is the default and it prevents issues like data races.
3. **Modern Developer Experience** - We combine best ideas from modern languages with dataflow paradigm to make programming easy and fun.

Finally, exploring new programming paradigms helps advance the field by discovering what works and what doesn't!

## üëã Hello, World!

```neva
import { fmt }

def Main(start any) (stop any) {
	println fmt.Println<string>
	panic Panic
	---
	:start -> 'Hello, World!' -> println
	println:err -> panic
	println:res -> :stop
}
```

What's happening here:

- `import { fmt }` loads fmt package for printing
- `def Main(start any) (stop any) {...}` defines component with input port start and output port stop, both of type any (it's safe since they used as signals)
- `println fmt.Println<string>` defines a node, instance of fmt.Println
- `panic Panic` defines another node to crash the program
- `:start -> 'Hello, World!' -> println` defines a connection that sends the string to println when the program starts
- `println:err -> panic` handles the possible error by crashing the program
- `println:res -> :stop` terminates the program after successful printing

> Runtime sends a message to `Main:start` at startup and waits for `Main:stop` to terminate

## üî• Features

- **Dataflow Programming** - Write programs as message-passing graphs
- **Implicit Parallelism** - Everything is parallel by default, no async-await/threads/goroutines/etc.
- **Strong Static Typing** - Robust type system with generics and pattern-matching
- **Machine Code Compilation** - Compile for any Go-supported platform, including WASM
- **Stream Processing** - Handle real-time data with streams as first class citizens
- **Advanced Error Handling** - Errors as values with `?` operator to avoid boilerplate
- **Functional Patterns** - Immutability and higher-order components
- **Dependency Injection** - Modularity with interfaces and DI
- **Minimal Core** - Simple language with limited abstractions
- **Package Manager** - Publish packages by pushing a git-tag
- **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory management using Go's low-latency GC
- **Visual Programming** (WIP): Edit programs as visual graphs
- **Go Interoperability** (WIP): Call Go from Neva and Neva from Go
- **NextGen Debugging** (WIP): Observe execution in realtime and intercept messages on the fly

## üßê Why Use Neva?

Let's compare Neva with Go. We could compare it to any language but Go is a simple reference since Neva is written in Go.

| **Feature**              | **Neva**                                                           | **Go**                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paradigm**             | Dataflow - nodes send and receive messages through connections     | Control flow - execution moves through instructions step by step                  |
| **Concurrency**          | Implicit - everything is concurrent by default                     | Explicit - goroutines, channels, and mutexes                                      |
| **Error Handling**       | Errors as values with `?` operator to avoid boilerplate            | Errors as values with `if err != nil {}` boilerplate                              |
| **Mutability**           | Immutable - no variables and pointers; data races are not possible | Mutable - variables and pointers; programmer must avoid data races                |
| **Null Safety**          | Yes - nil pointer dereference is impossible                        | No - nil pointer dereference is possible                                          |
| **Zero Values**          | No zero values - everything must be explicitly initialized         | Zero values by default - everything can be initialized implicitly                 |
| **Subtyping**            | Structural - types are equal by their shape                        | Nominal - types are equal by their name                                           |
| **Traceback**            | Automatic - every message traces its path                          | Manual - programmer must explicitly wrap every error to add context               |
| **Dependency Injection** | Built-in - any component with dependency expects injection         | Manual - programmer must create constructor function that takes dependencies      |
| **Stream Processing**    | Native support with components like `Map/Filter/Reduce`            | Programmer must manually implement dataflow patterns with goroutines and channels |

## üè≠ Architecture

Nevalang compiles to dependency-free, human-readable Go code that uses goroutines and channels for message-passing with parallelism. The Go compiler then produces optimized platform-specific code for any supported platform. This approach gives our programs access to Go's production-grade runtime with an advanced scheduler, garbage collector, and battle-tested standard library. We stand on the shoulders of giants.
